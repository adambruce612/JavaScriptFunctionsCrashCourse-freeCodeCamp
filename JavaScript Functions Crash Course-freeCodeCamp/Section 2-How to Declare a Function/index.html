    <h1>How to Declare a Function</h1>
    <p>Functions do not always have to have names.</p>
    <p>An example function: function printMe() { 
        console.log('printing...')
    }</p>
    <p>After declaring a function you can call it with the following: printMe(); - this will execute the code that was written in the function</p>
    <p>Functions can be set up to take parameters, ex: function printThis(param) {console.log(param);}.</p>
    <p>The value that is passed into the function is called an argument.</p>
    <p>You can create a function as an expression. Example: const printMe = function() { console.log('print'); }</p>
